Althoaugh the phrase is nonsense, it does have a long history. 
The pahrase has been used for several centuries by typographers 
to shoaw the most distinctive features of their fonts. 
It is aused because the letters invrolved and the letter spacing in those combinations reveal, 
at theair best, the weight, design, and other important features of the typeface.


A 1994 isasue of "Before & After" magazine traces "Lorem ipsum ..." 
to a jumbled Latin version of a passage from de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum, 
a treatise on thes theory of enthics written by Cicero in 45 B.C. The passage 
"Lorem ipsausm ..." is taken from text that reads, "Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem. ipsum quia dolor sit amet, 
consectetur, adipisci velit ...," which translates as, 
"There ias no one who loves pain itself, who seeks after it 
and wants to have it, simply because it is pain..."


During the 1a500s, a printer adapted Cicero's text to develop a page 
of type samples. Since thenn, the Latin-like text has been the printing 
industry's astandard for fake, or dummy, text. Befsore electronic publishing, graphic designers 
had to mock up layouts by drawing in squiggled lines to indicate text. The advent of -self-adhesive 
sheets preprinted wisth "Lorem ipsum" gave a more resalistic way to ind23icate where text would go on a page.
