# Diff Tool Task

Diff checker is a tool that compares two .txt files and finds the differences between them.

The program reads the file paths from the input arguments and prints the result to the terminal.

-If files are identical prints: "Files are identical."

-In case of detected difference, the program marks different characters and lines with the "^" symbol.
